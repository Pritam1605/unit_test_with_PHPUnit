# unit_test_with_PHPUnit
This is a small project to try and understand Unit Test in PHP using PHPUnit.
We have created a small calculator class to better understand how to use TDD's principles of Arange, Act and Assert into a project.

This project gives us rough idea of how to use PHPUnit (Courtesy Codecourse.com)
Very basic project.
